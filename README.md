# Chat-app
About

This repository contains the code for a simple chat application built using Node.js and HTML. This project demonstrates the basic concepts of building a real-time chat application.

Features

Real-time Chat: Users can send and receive messages in real-time.
Simple UI: A basic HTML interface for user interaction.
Node.js Backend: A Node.js server handles message broadcasting and routing.
Getting Started

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Heemapradhan00/Chat-app.git
Install Dependencies:

cd Chat-app
npm install
Start the Server:
node server.js
Open the Chat:
Open the caeser.html file in your web browser.

How it Works

Client-side:

The caeser.html file creates a simple chat interface with a message input and a display area.
When a user sends a message, it is sent to the server using a WebSocket connection.
Server-side:

The server.js file creates a Node.js server that listens for WebSocket connections.
When a message is received from a client, the server broadcasts it to all connected clients.

Additional Notes

This is a simple demonstration project and may not be suitable for production environments.
You can customize the chat interface and server logic to add more features like user authentication, private messaging, and file sharing.
For more complex chat applications, consider using a dedicated WebSocket library like Socket.IO.
I hope this README is helpful!
